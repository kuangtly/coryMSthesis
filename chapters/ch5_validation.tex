Without loss of generality, We injected binary blackhole signals to test performance of our De-Whitening Filter. Unfortunately, at this moment, we couldn't find a compatible data-taking system with desired noise level and dynamical range to faithfully reconstruct or estimate the expect End-Test Mirror (ETM) displacement that generated by our Photon Calibrator. The reason is that the ADC we used has much larger noise than DAC we used. If we amplify the signal before ADC, as what we did for noise measurement in last chapter, some part of injected waveform can easily saturate ADC.

\red{Besides, We have tried to inject Sine-Gaussian signals.
Noise measurement
around 100Hz  the noise should below the IFO sensitivity
Transfer Function measurement
“above 1kHz” performance
time delay of excitation channel
(absolute timing measurement?)
Distortion of Scientific Signal
