Without loss of generality, We injected binary blackhole   signals to test performance of our De-Whitening Filter.....

Besides, We have tried to inject Sine-Gaussian signals.




Noise measurement
around 100Hz  the nose should below the IFO sensitivity
Transfer Function measurement
“above 1kHz” performance
time delay of excitation channel
(absolute timing measurement?)
Distortion of Scientific Signal
BBH
BNS post merger
